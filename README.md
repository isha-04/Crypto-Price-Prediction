# Crypto-Price-Prediction

In todayâ€™s emerging world, cryptocurrency has evolved and grown to great extents and understanding such complex trends is extremely difficult and unpredictable. Therefore, analysis of cryptocurrency with precise predictions is important to keep up with the developing industry. In this project we aim to forecast the closing price of cryptocurrencies.

Description of methods:<br/>
Time-series analysis can predict the future ups and downs in the price of Bitcoin. Our methods for this purpose include developing time-series forecasting models using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory); and classical models using Decision Trees, Random Forest and XGBoost and determine if our dataset works best by a time-series approach or a regression approach.
